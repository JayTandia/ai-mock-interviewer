## üìö Detailed Usage Guide

### üß© Core Functionality

The core functionality revolves around simulating a realistic interview experience.  The AI generates questions tailored to the user's specified role and experience, allowing users to practice their responses.  The speech-to-text transcription and AI-powered feedback loop provide valuable insights for improvement.

```javascript
// Example: Fetching AI-generated questions

import { generateInterviewQuestions } from './lib/ai';

async function createInterview(jobTitle, jobDescription, yearsOfExperience) {
  const questions = await generateInterviewQuestions(jobTitle, jobDescription, yearsOfExperience);
  return questions;
}

// Example usage
createInterview("Software Engineer", "Develop and maintain web applications", 3)
  .then(questions => console.log(questions))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

The primary configuration options are managed through environment variables in the `.env.local` file. These options control database connections, API keys, and authentication settings. Ensure that these variables are set correctly for the application to function properly.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

*   **Database Connection Errors:** Verify that the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is correctly set and that your Neon database is running.
*   **API Key Errors:**  Double-check that your Google Gemini API Key and Clerk API keys are valid and have the necessary permissions.
*   **Webcam/Microphone Issues:**  Ensure that your webcam and microphone are properly connected and that the application has permission to access them.  Check your browser's privacy settings.
*   **Speech-to-Text Errors:** Ensure you are speaking clearly and that your microphone is functioning correctly. Try refreshing the page.
